## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cometchat-assignment.git
   cd cometchat-assignment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Login with any UID created in your CometChat dashboard (e.g., `user1`, `user2`)

## üîë CometChat Credentials

Stored in `src/constants.js`:
```javascript
export const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
  APP_ID: "275545190c4ca01f",
  REGION: "in",
  AUTH_KEY: "32a765aeecc246b7f76aea6ff7c985eaf92d4b4e",
};
```

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced

- **No default users provided** ‚Äî Had to manually create test UIDs like `user1`, `user2`
- **Limited Visual Builder docs** ‚Äî Required back-and-forth with official UI Kit documentation
- **Confusion with Auth Keys** ‚Äî Accidentally used the REST key initially instead of Auth key

## ‚úÖ How I Solved Them

- Created test users in the CometChat dashboard
- Used CometChat‚Äôs official UI Kit setup tutorial
- Debugged login failures by printing `CometChat.login` errors in console

## üí° Suggestions for CometChat

- Add default test users to all new apps automatically
- Include a visual example of where to plug UI Kit files into a React app
- Separate REST API key and Auth key more clearly in dashboard
